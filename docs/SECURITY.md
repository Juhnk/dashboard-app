# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We take security seriously and actively maintain security updates for the following versions of Mustache Cashstage:

| Version | Supported          | Support Level |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------- |

### 🛡️ Vulnerability Assessment Criteria

We use the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1 to assess vulnerability severity:

#### **Critical (9.0 - 10.0)**
- **Impact**: Complete system compromise, data breach, or service disruption
- **Examples**: Remote code execution, SQL injection with data access, authentication bypass
- **Response Time**: 24 hours acknowledgment, 72 hours initial fix

#### **High (7.0 - 8.9)**
- **Impact**: Significant system compromise or data exposure
- **Examples**: Privilege escalation, cross-site scripting with data access, insecure direct object references
- **Response Time**: 48 hours acknowledgment, 1 week initial fix

#### **Medium (4.0 - 6.9)**
- **Impact**: Limited system compromise or information disclosure
- **Examples**: Cross-site scripting (non-persistent), information leakage, weak authentication
- **Response Time**: 1 week acknowledgment, 2 weeks initial fix

#### **Low (0.1 - 3.9)**
- **Impact**: Minimal security impact
- **Examples**: Information disclosure (non-sensitive), minor configuration issues
- **Response Time**: 2 weeks acknowledgment, next release cycle fix

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### 🔒 Secure Development Guidelines

#### **Code Review Security Checklist**
- [ ] Input validation implemented for all user inputs
- [ ] Output encoding applied to prevent XSS
- [ ] Authentication and authorization checks in place
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Proper error handling without information leakage
- [ ] Secure random number generation where needed
- [ ] SQL queries use parameterized statements
- [ ] File upload restrictions and validation implemented

#### **Environment Security**
```bash
# Use secure environment variable handling
# ✅ Good
const dbUrl = process.env.DATABASE_URL || 'fallback-for-dev'

# ❌ Bad - exposes sensitive data in logs
console.log('Connecting to:', process.env.DATABASE_URL)

# ✅ Good - secure logging
console.log('Connecting to database...')
```

#### **API Security Patterns**
```typescript
// ✅ Secure API endpoint example
@Controller('data-sources')
export class DataSourceController {
  @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RoleGuard)
  @Roles('admin', 'editor')
  @Get(':id')
  async getDataSource(
    @Param('id', ParseUUIDPipe) id: string,
    @CurrentUser() user: User
  ) {
    // Validate user has access to this resource
    const dataSource = await this.dataSourceService.findByIdAndUser(id, user.id);
    if (!dataSource) {
      throw new NotFoundException('Data source not found');
    }
    return dataSource;
  }
}
```

### 🛡️ Security Testing Requirements

#### **Required Security Tests**
- **Authentication Testing**: Verify all protected endpoints require valid authentication
- **Authorization Testing**: Ensure role-based access controls work correctly
- **Input Validation**: Test all inputs for injection attacks and malformed data
- **Session Management**: Verify secure session handling and timeout
- **Error Handling**: Ensure no sensitive information leaks in error messages

#### **Automated Security Scanning**
We use automated tools to continuously monitor security:
- **Dependency Scanning**: `npm audit` and Snyk integration
- **Static Code Analysis**: ESLint security rules and SonarQube
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image vulnerability scanning
- **Dynamic Testing**: Automated penetration testing in staging
