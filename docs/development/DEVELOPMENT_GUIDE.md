# 🚀 DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT GUIDE

## Quick Start

```bash
# Health check (recommended first step)
npm run health

# Start development environment
npm run dev

# Manual Docker management
npm run docker:dev    # Start services
npm run docker:down   # Stop services
npm run docker:restart # Restart services
npm run docker:logs   # View logs
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Port Conflicts (Normal Behavior)
```
⚠ Port 3000 is in use, trying 3001 instead.
⚠ Port 3001 is in use, trying 3002 instead.
```

**This is NORMAL and expected behavior.** Next.js automatically finds the next available port. The warnings are just informational.

### Next.js Configuration Warning (FIXED)
```
⚠ Invalid next.config.js options detected: 
⚠ Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'appDir' at "experimental"
```

**Status: ✅ RESOLVED** - The deprecated `appDir` option has been removed from `next.config.js`.

## 🏥 Health Checks

### Comprehensive Health Check
```bash
npm run health
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🏥 Mustache Cashstache Health Check
====================================

🐳 Docker Services:
   ✅ mustache-adminer: Up X minutes
   ✅ mustache-postgres: Up X minutes (healthy)
   ✅ mustache-redis: Up X minutes (healthy)

🗄️  Database:
   ✅ PostgreSQL connection healthy
   ✅ Database schema ready (11 tables)

🗃️  Cache:
   ✅ Redis connection healthy

🔌 Port Status:
   ⚠️ Port 3000 (Next.js): In Use [NORMAL]
   ⚠️ Port 3001 (Next.js): In Use [NORMAL]
   ⚠️ Port 3002 (Next.js): In Use [NORMAL]
   ✅ Port 5432 (PostgreSQL): In Use
   ✅ Port 6379 (Redis): In Use
   ✅ Port 8080 (Adminer): In Use

📝 Code Quality:
   ✅ TypeScript compilation successful

📋 Overall Status:
   ✅ All systems healthy! Ready for development.
```

### Manual Service Checks

#### Docker Services
```bash
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\\t{{.Status}}\\t{{.Ports}}"
```

#### Database Connection
```bash
docker exec mustache-postgres pg_isready -U mustache -d mustache_dev
```

#### Redis Connection
```bash
docker exec mustache-redis redis-cli ping
# Expected: PONG
```

#### Database Tables
```bash
docker exec mustache-postgres psql -U mustache -d mustache_dev -c "\\dt"
```

## 🌐 Service URLs

| Service | URL | Credentials |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **Frontend** | http://localhost:3000+ | - |
| **Database Admin** | http://localhost:8080 | Server: `postgres`<br>User: `mustache`<br>Password: `mustache_dev_password`<br>Database: `mustache_dev` |
| **PostgreSQL** | localhost:5432 | Same as above |
| **Redis** | localhost:6379 | No auth required |

## 🔧 Development Commands

### Core Development
```bash
npm run dev          # Smart startup with health checks
npm run dev:simple   # Basic Turbo dev (no health checks)
npm run dev:web      # Only web app (requires services running)
```

### Docker Management
```bash
npm run docker:dev     # Start all services
npm run docker:down    # Stop all services  
npm run docker:restart # Stop and start services
npm run docker:logs    # View service logs
```

### Code Quality
```bash
npm run typecheck   # TypeScript validation
npm run lint        # ESLint validation
npm run format      # Prettier formatting
npm run build       # Production build test
```

### Maintenance
```bash
npm run clean   # Clean build artifacts
npm run reset   # Clean and reinstall everything
npm run health  # Comprehensive health check
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Docker services not running"
```bash
# Solution
npm run docker:dev
```

### Issue: "Database connection failed"
```bash
# Check if containers are running
docker ps

# Restart Docker services
npm run docker:restart

# Check logs for errors
npm run docker:logs
```

### Issue: "Port already in use"
**This is normal behavior.** Next.js will automatically find the next available port. The warnings are informational only.

### Issue: "TypeScript errors"
```bash
# Check for errors
npm run typecheck

# Fix formatting issues
npm run format
```

### Issue: Next.js won't start
```bash
# Use our smart startup script
npm run dev

# Or check what's using the ports
lsof -i :3000 -i :3001 -i :3002
```

## 📊 Port Assignment Strategy

| Port Range | Purpose | Behavior |
|------------|---------|----------|
| 3000 | Next.js (preferred) | Auto-fallback if in use |
| 3001 | Next.js (fallback 1) | Auto-fallback if in use |
| 3002 | Next.js (fallback 2) | Auto-fallback if in use |
| 5432 | PostgreSQL | Fixed assignment |
| 6379 | Redis | Fixed assignment |
| 8080 | Adminer (DB Admin) | Fixed assignment |

## 🔒 Security Notes

- **Development only**: All credentials are for development environment only
- **Docker isolation**: Services run in isolated Docker containers
- **Local access**: All services bound to localhost only
- **No production data**: Never use these credentials in production

## 📝 Database Schema

The application creates 11 tables:
- `organizations` - Multi-tenant organization data
- `users` - User accounts with roles
- `dashboards` - Dashboard configurations  
- `dashboard_tabs` - Tab-based organization
- `widgets` - Chart/widget configurations
- `data_sources` - Connected data sources
- `data_snapshots` - Cached data (partitioned)
- `themes` - Custom branding
- `audit_logs` - Activity tracking

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### Complete Reset
```bash
# Stop everything
npm run docker:down

# Clean everything
npm run reset

# Start fresh
npm run dev
```

### View All Logs
```bash
# Docker services
npm run docker:logs

# Next.js logs (if running separately)
cd apps/web && npm run dev
```

### Force Port Release
```bash
# Find processes using ports
lsof -i :3000 -i :3001 -i :3002

# Kill specific process (if needed)
kill -9 <PID>

# Or use our smart startup
npm run dev
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Before starting development, verify:

- [ ] `npm run health` shows all green checkmarks
- [ ] Database admin accessible at http://localhost:8080
- [ ] Frontend loads at reported URL (3000+)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors: `npm run typecheck`
- [ ] Docker services running: `docker ps`

## 🎯 Next Steps

With the environment verified and healthy, you can now:

1. **Continue Development**: Implement authentication system
2. **Access Services**: Use the URLs above to interact with services
3. **Monitor Health**: Run `npm run health` periodically
4. **View Database**: Use Adminer at http://localhost:8080
