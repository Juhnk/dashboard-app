## Strategic Gap Assessment

### 🔴 **CRITICAL GAPS (Must Fix for MVP)**

#### 1. **Chart Interactivity** - *Blocking Core Value Proposition*
- **Current State**: Charts are static display-only components
- **Looker Studio Standard**: Click-to-filter, hover tooltips, drill-down navigation
- **Business Impact**: Users cannot explore data → No analytical value
- **Implementation Effort**: 2-3 weeks
- **Files to Update**: `apps/web/src/components/charts/*.tsx`

#### 2. **Widget Edit Reliability** - *Core Functionality Broken*
- **Current State**: "Not yet implemented" errors on widget updates
- **Looker Studio Standard**: Seamless inline editing with real-time preview
- **Business Impact**: Users cannot modify dashboards → Product unusable
- **Implementation Effort**: 1-2 weeks
- **Files to Update**: `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/enhanced-widget-configuration-modal.tsx`

#### 3. **Data Source Integration** - *Foundation Missing*
- **Current State**: Only Google Sheets partially working, no other connectors
- **Looker Studio Standard**: 24 Google + 1000+ partner connectors
- **Business Impact**: Cannot connect to real business data → Demo-only product
- **Implementation Effort**: 4-6 weeks for initial set
- **Priority Connectors**: Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, PostgreSQL, CSV upload

#### 4. **Export & Sharing** - *Enterprise Requirement*

## Conclusion

**Current Status**: Mustache Cashstage has a superior technical foundation but lacks critical interactive features that make Looker Studio valuable to users.

**Strategic Position**: The product is approximately 60% complete toward MVP and 40% toward market parity with Looker Studio.

**Critical Decision Point**: Focus exclusively on the 4-6 critical gaps before pursuing advanced features. Without reliable widget editing and chart interactivity, the product cannot demonstrate its core value proposition.

**Competitive Advantage Opportunity**: The modern technical stack and multi-tenant architecture provide a foundation for surpassing Looker Studio in enterprise scenarios, but only after achieving feature parity on core functionality.

**Recommendation**: Execute Phase 1 immediately with dedicated focus, then reassess market position before proceeding to Phase 2.
