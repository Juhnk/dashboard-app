# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* **Being respectful and inclusive** in all communications and interactions
* **Demonstrating empathy and kindness** toward other community members
* **Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback** on code and ideas
* **Accepting responsibility** for our mistakes and learning from the experience
* **Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* **Using welcoming and inclusive language** in all discussions and documentation
* **Being patient with newcomers** and those learning new technologies
* **Providing helpful, actionable feedback** in code reviews and discussions
* **Celebrating diverse perspectives** and approaches to problem-solving
* **Maintaining professionalism** in all project-related communications

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* **Harassment or discrimination** of any kind, including but not limited to offensive comments related to personal characteristics
* **Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments** about code, ideas, or individuals
* **Public or private harassment** including unwelcome contact or attention
* **Publishing private information** without explicit permission (doxxing)
* **Sexual language or imagery** and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* **Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following** online or in person
* **Advocating for or encouraging** any of the above behaviors
* **Disrupting discussions** or derailing conversations with off-topic content
* **Spamming or excessive self-promotion** unrelated to project contributions
* **Any conduct that is reasonably considered inappropriate** in a professional setting

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Code Review Standards
* **Focus on the code, not the person** - critique ideas and implementations, not individuals
* **Provide specific, actionable feedback** with suggestions for improvement
* **Acknowledge good work** and celebrate quality contributions
* **Be patient with learning curves** - everyone has different experience levels
* **Ask clarifying questions** instead of making assumptions about intent

### Communication Guidelines
* **Use inclusive language** in all documentation, comments, and discussions
* **Avoid technical jargon** when simpler explanations would be more helpful
* **Provide context** for decisions and suggestions to help others learn
* **Respect different time zones and response times** in international collaborations
* **Use appropriate channels** for different types of communication (issues, discussions, PRs)

### Technical Collaboration
* **Welcome diverse approaches** to solving problems - there's often more than one right way
* **Share knowledge generously** through documentation, comments, and discussions
* **Credit others' contributions** appropriately in code and documentation
* **Be open to learning** new techniques and technologies from fellow contributors
* **Collaborate constructively** on architecture decisions and technical direction

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct also applies to:
* **All project repositories** and their associated discussions, issues, and pull requests
* **Project-related communication channels** including Discord, Slack, or other chat platforms
* **Technical conferences and meetups** where project members are representing the project
* **Social media interactions** when clearly associated with the project
* **Private communications** between community members regarding project-related matters

## Reporting Guidelines

### How to Report

**Email**: [conduct@mustache-cashstage.dev] (replace with actual email)
**GitHub**: Create a private issue using the "Report Code of Conduct Violation" template

When reporting, please include:

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

**Example Actions**:
* Private conversation about inappropriate language in a pull request
* Request to revise comments or documentation using more inclusive language
* Guidance on more constructive ways to provide feedback

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

**Example Actions**:
* Temporary restriction from commenting on issues or pull requests
* Required review of all contributions before acceptance
* Mandatory completion of community guidelines training

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

**Duration**: Typically 30-90 days depending on severity

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been unfairly penalized under this Code of Conduct, you may appeal the decision by:

1. **Submitting an appeal** within 30 days of the enforcement action
2. **Providing new evidence** or context that wasn't considered in the original decision
3. **Demonstrating rehabilitation** for more serious violations
4. **Requesting mediation** from an independent third party if available

Appeals should be sent to the same contact methods used for reporting violations.

## Positive Recognition

We believe in recognizing and celebrating positive community behavior. Examples include:

* **Mentorship**: Helping newcomers get started with contributions
* **Quality Contributions**: Submitting well-documented, tested code
* **Community Building**: Facilitating inclusive discussions and collaborations
* **Knowledge Sharing**: Creating helpful documentation or tutorials
* **Constructive Feedback**: Providing thoughtful, actionable code reviews

Outstanding community members may be recognized through:
* Public acknowledgment in project communications
* Invitation to join project leadership or advisory roles
* Speaking opportunities at project-related events
* Special contributor status or badges
